            <p>The exercise shown in the image is commonly known as a leg raise, which is a core-strengthening exercise
                that primarily targets the abdominal muscles.
                How to perform a leg raise:
                Lie on your back on a mat with your arms at your sides, palms facing down.
                Keep your legs straight and together.
                Engage your core muscles and lift your legs off the ground, keeping them straight, until they are
                perpendicular to the floor.
                Slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position, controlling the movement.
                Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.

                Engage the core and bring the right elbow towards the left knee while extending the right leg.
                Alternate sides, bringing the left elbow towards the right knee and extending the left leg.
                Continue alternating sides in a pedaling motion.
                Bicycle crunches are effective for strengthening core muscles, improving stability, and enhancing
                overall fitness. They are a popular exercise choice for individuals seeking to target their
                abs and obliques.</p>

            <h2>Push-Ups</h2>
            <p>The exercise shown in the image is called a push-up. It is a bodyweight exercise that primarily works the
                muscles of the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Push-ups also engage the core muscles and can help to
                improve posture and balance.
                To perform a standard push-up:
                Begin in a plank position with hands shoulder-width apart, palms flat on the floor, and body in a
                straight line from head to heels.
                Lower the body towards the floor, keeping the elbows at a 45-degree angle.
                Push back up to the starting position.</p>

            <h2>Dumbbell Lunge</h2>
            <p>The exercise shown in the image is a dumbbell lunge, specifically a reverse lunge with dumbbells. Here's
                a breakdown of the exercise:
                Starting Position:
                The person is standing with feet hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
                Movement:
                They step backward with one leg, lowering the body until both knees are bent at approximately 90-degree
                angles.
                The front knee is aligned over the ankle, and the back knee hovers just above the ground.
                The torso is upright, and the core is engaged.
                They push off with the front foot to return to the starting position.</p>

            <h2>Lunge</h2>
            <p>The exercise shown in the image is called a lunge. It is a lower-body exercise that works several muscle
                groups, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. Lunges are a versatile exercise that
                can be modified to increase or decrease the difficulty, and they can be done with or without weights.
                Here's how to properly perform a lunge:
                Start by standing with feet hip-width apart.
                Step forward with one leg, lowering your body until both knees are bent at a 90-degree angle. Make sure
                the front knee is directly over the ankle and the back knee is not touching the ground.
                Push off with the front foot to return to the starting position.
                Repeat on the other side.</p>

            <p>The exercise shown in the image is called a Side Plank with Twist. It is a variation of the standard side
                plank that adds a rotational movement to engage the core muscles further and improve spinal mobility. To
                perform this exercise, one should:
                Start in a side plank position, either on the knees or feet, with the body in a straight line.
                Place the top hand behind the head or on the hip.
                Rotate the torso forward, bringing the top elbow towards the ground while maintaining stability in the
                hips and core.
                Return to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions before switching sides.
